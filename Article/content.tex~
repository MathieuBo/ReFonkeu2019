\section{Introduction}

Neurons, like all other cells, require proteins to function. Because of their morphological diversity and the fact that synapses can be hundreds of micrometers away from the some, neurons require an exquisite control of protein and mRNA distributions in both time and space.
Experimental evidence indicate the presence of mRNA in dendrites and recent reports highlight the importance of local translation in various forms of synaptic plasticities \supercite{Hafner2019, Younts2016}.
